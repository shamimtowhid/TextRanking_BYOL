It is considered the mother tongue or native language of most Spaniards and serves as a common link between all citizens regardless of their regional backgrounds. This standardized form of Spanish is used by government institutions, media, education systems, etc., making it highly influential in unifying the nation.

Regional Languages:

* Catalan: Spoken mainly in Catalonia, including Barcelona, this language has co-official status with Spanish in that region's autonomous community.

* Farmer: As a young man, Lincoln worked on his family's farm in Kentucky and Indiana. He helped cultivate crops, raise livestock, and work wooded areas. These skills likely prepared him for later life as a Surveyor, Constable, and Postmaster General.
* Surveying / Land Speculating: In his early twenties (c. 1823), Lincoln began surveying land as it provided good pay but bred skepticism from neighbors and his own father because he could not afford to buy books needed to become lawyer.[5] During this period until roughly four years into his law career,[6] he also became involved in land speculation ventures with John D Stuart.[7][5] A combination of financial successes from these ventures plus smart investments allowed him to purchase his own home while still single; Lincoln Hill on the grounds of the Illinois State Capitol is built where that house stood. The financial stability gained then led Lincoln to enter politics.[6][8][9] His surveying experience would aid him well when serving as a Whig member of the US House of Representatives during the Mexican–American War.
* Militia:  At age 24 or so, Lincoln joined a volunteer militia company though details are cloudy due to lack of written documents by anyone at the time and missing documentation in state historical society archives today [references].[2][10][11]
* Lawyer: Starting around ages 24-25 after learning grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, geometry solid mensuration,[2] and trigonometry,[12] under the tutoring from someone named “Old Buck”, Lincoln studied law alone without attending any law school or college courses despite encouragement from his legal mentor Judge James Lemen nor reading anything other than biographies and works of political economy including some speech writing advice using the same method as he previously self educated himself twice: once prior via postal delivery through post offices scattered between Springfield IL & Washington DC then second when mailing letters back home from Missouri following his first legislative session.[13] One source states in 1831 he began law practice following successful reelection campaigns.[14] Another cites that he first started practicing during initial term of service ending March","Statesman Before Abraham Lincoln became the 16th President of the United States, he had a variety of jobs and experiences.

Lister continued expanding on techniques using dilute solutions of chloride of lime and began using charcoal pads or bandages soaked in antiseptics to control localised abdominal infection and suppuration resulting from injuries and perforated intestines and other gut hollows.[6] Despite much interest after this presentation from eminent physicians like Charles Hilton Florence and John Goodsir Ewing Forbes it would be several years before any papers by Lister describing surgical use appeared, including some initial failures despite successful ones.[6] A paper presented two decades previously by James Syme suggested that ammonia might help stop contamination and act as an antiseptic during life saving gut surgery; initially this seemed ideal until it became clear via case reports of unintended adverse reactions that ammonium salts caused severe damage locally and then remotely through internal inflammation.[6] This meant that attempts at introducing sterile environments by earlier proponents met many challenges requiring better application technology before they could become viable clinical options.

* Measurement of e/m for electrons: In his famous cathode ray tube experiment conducted in 1897, Thomson found that the ratio between charge-to-mass (e/m) of these particles is constant and independent of their velocity or other properties. This resulted in one of his Nobel Prizes, awarded in 1906 for ""his work on the interaction of electricity and matter"".

He is known for making major reforms to the structure of the Roman Empire, and he established an autocratic rule that marked the transition between the Classical Era and the Christian Middle Ages.

Diocletian was born in Dalmatia (modern Croatia) into an illegitimate family of low rank within the imperial court.

The pre-Columbian era's influence continues to be seen in Mexican traditions and celebrations like Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), an important part of modern Mexican culture where families gather together to remember and honor loved ones who have passed away.
India: A land diverse in geography, climate, languages, and ethnicity, Indian culture is distinctive for its spiritual practices with over 80% of its population adhering to Hinduism, yet there also sizable Muslim, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Jain populations that shape its cultural landscape. Its ancient civilization enriched by the Vedic, Mauryan, Gupta, Mughal and British eras has produced some world renowned architectural works including the Taj Mahal and other forms of impressive art, literature, cuisine and dress unique to each region. Some festivals of note include Diwali or 'the festival of lights', celebrating peace, wealth and love or Holi where communities come together for spring fun. India takes great pride in having been chosen as birthplace of two world faiths – Hinduism & Buddhism both embracing Ahimsa / non violence philosophy .
Japan: Traditional and steeped in history, Japanese culture places strong emphasis on community harmony rather than individualism making it resilient through natural disasters or societal change.

Both processors have six cores and twelve threads, but there are some differences to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item Intel Core i5-10600F has a base clock speed of up to 3 GHz and can boost up to 4.8 GHz in single-core mode and up to 4.5 GHz in multi-core mode. It also includes support for Thermal Velocity Control (TDC) technology, allowing it to manage power usage more efficiently. This makes the processor well suited for tasks that require high clock speeds and efficient heat dissipation.
\item AMD Ryzen 7 5800G has a maximum turbo frequency of up to 4.8 GHz and can handle twice as many threads as the Intel CPU due to its inclusion of SMT architecture. However, its base clock speed is slightly lower than the Intel CPU at just 2.9 GHz and does not include TDC technology for improved efficiency. As such, this processor may be better suited for applications that do not require continuous high clock speeds.

Overall, the choice between these two processors will depend largely on the nature of your workload. If you're using demanding applications that require sustained high clock speeds and good cooling properties, the Intel Core i5-10600F would likely be preferable. However, if you prioritize thread count over clock speed, or if your application benefits from SMT parallelism, then the AMD Ryzen 7 5800G might be more appropriate for your use case","Inside Intel: Andy Grove and the Rise of the World's Most Powerful Chip Company The Core i5-10600F and AMD Ryzen 7 5800G are both high-end processors with similar performance capabilities, so the choice between them depends on your specific needs.

459,459,http://www.freebase.com/view/en/dominican_republic,where is the best place to vacation in the dominican republic?,Santo Domingo,"The Dominican Republic has a lot of beautiful places that you can visit and enjoy your time there. Some popular areas include:
- Samana, which is located on the northeastern part of the country, known for its beautiful beaches like Playa Rincon, Cayo Levantado, and Las Galeras; also if you are looking for an all inclusive experience some resorts have that option as well.  If you prefer relaxing by the beach or pool without too many activities nearby this could be an excellent choice. Be aware it may take longer travel times compared to other locations due to being further from major cities.  A variety of flights land in Santo Domingo (SDQ) and Santiago (JBQ), with JetBlue operating direct flights out of NYC area airports. From Santo Domingo, you need to drive about three hours until you get to a city named Nagua then another hour will bring you finally to Samana town proper along a newly constructed road from the Northwest or taking a ferry transferring from Punta Codet. There are taxis available but getting one might require your hotel or locals help so better confirm ahead of check in! In case driving after dark may make you uncomfortable just double check at front desk for their assistance in advance.  This location is likely most suitable for families since most hotels offer All Inclusive package plans including children programs during certain hours of daytime.  
Another location is Santo Domingo (not to be confused with Santo Domingo Este - city area within Santo Domingo Province). Santo Domingo Area includes Boca Chica beach known among tourists going there via public transportations coming from other parts of the country such as La Romana or Juan Dolio etc., plus hotels in Santo Domingo Este like Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton Santo Domingo Este Hotel . This area has good reviews but I was not able to find any options to spend time on the water overnight and it seems more geared towards families rather than couples without kids. Hotels tend to block accesses inside the facilities around adult bedtimes except when hosting activities intended for children only. This destination should have less chances of getting rain disruptions unless there's something seriously wrong with global weather patterns! Accessible by bus/taxi locally easily once you get familiar with how those operate here. Taxi costs should average below $50 USD per ride anywhere nearby but better verify first before accepting any offers especially from people hanging out near stops waiting without uniforms. 
A third spot is La Romana, which also provides multiple choices depending on budget levels. Once you arrive at the international airport here using commercial flight services such as Delta Airlines, American, Southwest etc. or charter jets directly landing into SDQ airports coming from north America including Canada then shuttle transfers will take you next either to SantoDomingo Area or Bayahibe Area hotels respectively after checking luggages. Your stay starts right away boarding nice vessels while enjoying riverine sceneries before reaching Catalina Island for snorkeling excursions passing through Altos de Chavon and Casa De Campo marinas etc.. You have access to different restaurants serving traditional Hispanic foods instead of All Inclusion packages at these properties! No need to worry about meal options nor liquors anymore if your preference leans that way now. For sure everything is provided onsite except the golf course next door though!! For nightlife fun spots head over to nearby La Romana downtown by taxi around 20 minutes away before returning back to the same property. To stay even closer within Downtown yet still outside Santo Domingo Area would be somewhat dangerous at least based solely on Google Map alone since I did not go there myself so cannot provide you my own opinions or stories behind it.  Due to lower level income of this area lots of cars do not exist hence they are replaced by motorcycles instead which makes things easier finding parking spaces around residential neighborhoods especially at night thus reducing criminal activity potentials in broader sense despite lacking law enforcement officers patrolling regularly although your safety is still hard to guarantee compared to higher end local communities or foreigners staying temporarily at neighboring accommodations or privately owned properties . As long as visitors follow general rules learned elsewhere such as not flashing belongings when leaving tables at bars or restaurants open spaces nothing bad should happen in this tiny city full of lively human movements regardless of skin colors ..","Santo Domingo The Dominican Republic has a lot of beautiful places that you can visit and enjoy your time there.

He was associated with several major art movements during his time, including:

1. Fauvism (Les Fauves): In the early 20th century, Matisse helped found this movement that emphasized vibrant colors, bold brushstrokes, and simplified forms to express emotions and achieve decorative effects. This style can be seen in many of his works from around 1905 to 1908 or so.

2. Post-Fauve Period: Following the decline of Fauvism, Matisse adopted more subdued tones and refined compositions in his paintings. The simplified shapes, flat areas of color, and linear rhythm he developed influenced later developments in modern painting. You can see this style exemplified in pieces such as ""Danse II"" (oil on canvas) painted in 1910.
3. Analytic Cubism/Section d’Or Movement: During 1908–14 (approximately), Matisse began experimenting with basic geometric shapes like squares, rectangles, and triangles in order to analyze objects into their fundamental components. His work during this phase often incorporated faceted renderings of figures and still lifes using simple yet dynamic color schemes—all part of an overall trend known as Analytic Cubism that sought to depict items from multiple angles at once. Some fine illustrations include Still Life with Geranium (c. 1916), and Studio, Quai Saint-Michel (painted between 1907–1916).

He is considered one of the most important figures in Christian history for starting the Protestant Reformation, which led to significant changes in Western Christendom.

Luther's primary criticism of the Catholic Church revolved around two issues:
1) The sale of indulgences (certificates said to reduce punishment for sins committed), which he believed had no biblical basis and exploited people's faith.
2) Papal authority over individual conscience and interpretation of scripture. He argued that each person should have direct access to scripture without needing clergy intermediaries or papal approval.[3]

Luther also criticized other Catholic teachings such as celibacy among clergy and the veneration of saints. In response, church authorities issued an ultimatum threatening excommunication unless Luther recanted his views within a specified timeframe.[4] However, this only motivated him further and drew more opposition against them.[5][7][8]
In July 1518, Luther published an invitation asking for a public debate on these issues with respectful dialogue instead of threats from either side,[9] but he ultimately received no serious responses to discuss things peacefully.[4] Overall, Luther focused primarily on influencing people through writing treatises and tracts attacking various aspects of Catholic doctrine and practice.[7]","Physician As mentioned earlier, Martin Luther was a German monk and theologian who challenged certain practices of the Catholic Church in 16th century Europe.

Ulysses S. Grant, or USG as I will abbreviate him for brevity, was born April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, the son of an old-stock American family with farming roots going back several generations — which is important because throughout his life, USG often described himself not as having come from humble origins but as being poor farmer stock; it’s interesting to keep that self-descriptive identity consistent across all decades, isn’t it?) When the Civil War began, there were few military men better trained than this man who had graduated second out of a class of 39 at West Point. He would rise fastest among his peers (after President Lincoln), leading the Union Army during its darkest days through a swampy wilderness, under the baking sun of Cairo and St Louis when it seemed the cause might be lost, then to Memphis where it wasn’t even safe to land the boat carrying General Grant without being shot full of holes by Confederates lurking about, and eventually into Vicksburg in May 1863 where six months prior to arriving General GH Thomas called up “The Ordeal” (the battle itself) “a siege.” The tide turned toward their favor following such a brutally bloody climax: henceforth known as Missionary Ridge near Chattanooga November the next year where they took Lookout Mountain and Mission Ridge, followed by the Battle of Nashville in December 1864 against Hood before finally ending his service, retiring to Galena, Illinois — though he found time later to serve under three presidents as peace commissioner to Mexico where he negotiated an end to our small war there (it didn’t stick). In between these stints serving America abroad & at home (wherever there needed commanding), he also found himself appointed Commanding General of the Armies of the United States and performed duties both civilian and otherwise necessary enough to secure another election victory and term of office as the sitting president while overseeing Reconstruction after the civil war ended!","Grant rises in the West.

1945-1946: End of World War II marks a turning point for US foreign policy as Washington begins to assume a more active role on the global stage, particularly in Asia. In this period, the French begin reasserting their colonial control over Indochina (including what is now modern-day Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam). This leads to increasing tensions between the local communist movement and the French authorities, resulting in violent anti-colonial resistance by the Viet Minh independence organization.

Late 1940s - early 1950s: After three years of fighting, the Viet Minh decisively defeat the French at Dien Bien Phu in May 1954, effectively ending their rule in Vietnam. The Geneva Conference later divides Vietnam into two temporary zones along the 17th parallel until a national referendum can be held to reunify the country under one government. However, disagreements between North and South Vietnam delay the planned reunification process.

Mid-1950s: Amid growing fears of increased Soviet influence in Southeast Asia, President Eisenhower's administration increases economic aid and military support to Southern Vietnam in an effort to prevent a communist takeover. This eventually escalates into full-scale warfare after North Vietnam launches guerrilla attacks against South Vietnam in late 1956 and early 1957. By late 1959, Hanoi openly declares its intention to reunify Vietnam through force if necessary.

1963: Struggling with political instability, South Vietnam experiences yet another coup d'etat when Ngo Dinh Diem is assassinated in November during a Buddhist uprising.

During this time, there was an explosion of creativity in various forms of art, including literature, music, drama, and visual arts.

Writers of the Harlem Renaissance wrote on a wide range of subjects and themes related to black experiences and culture, such as:

* Identity: Many writers explored themes of identity, both individual and collective, and the complex ways in which race, class, gender, and sexuality intersect. They often wrote about their experiences growing up black in America, the struggles they faced because of systemic racism and discrimination, and their efforts to assert their unique identities within larger white-dominated society.
* Politics: Writers also addressed political issues affecting the black community, including civil rights, segregation, and discrimination. They used poetry, prose, essays, and plays to critique social structures and institutions that perpetuated inequality and oppression, as well as to imagine visions for a more equitable future.
* Urban life: Since many artists and writers during this era were living and working in urban environments like Harlem, much of the work produced during this period focused on urban life, including its joys and challenges. This included depictions of everyday people and neighborhoods, as well as stories and poems centered around issues like crime, poverty, housing shortages, labor organizing, and other pressing concerns facing city residents at that time.
* Arts and letters: Literary works by black authors from the Harlem Renaissance often include detailed descriptions of music, dance, theater, painting, sculpture, photography and film - the whole gamut of modernist art forms being developed across a wide array of media at the same time these texts are being created.

This idea was later refined by Johannes Kepler into a more precise mathematical system known as the ""Kepler's Laws.""
* Parallax measurement for the first time : He measured parallaxes of some nearby stars to show they are far away from us , he could even measure it by himself .
* Geometric theory of planetary motion: Copernicus formulated an alternative geometric system of predicting the positions of celestial bodies based on their relative distances from each other and the Sun.
* Improved astrolabes and clocks: Copernicus improved existing instruments such as astrolabes and clocks used for navigation, making them easier to use and more accurate.

Born on May 3rd, 1849 in Denmark, Riis immigrated with his family to America when he was just two years old. After a difficult childhood marked by illnesses and constant struggle, young Jacob discovered a love for drawing at age eleven. He then attended grammar school before being apprenticed to various businesses as a teenager where he learned English as second language (being Danish). By age twenty-two he took on journalism as a career while still working odd jobs due to harsh economic conditions faced by most citizens during post Civil War United States recovery era.

Riis became associate editor of New York Evening Sun in 1873; his first exposé featured a corrupt politician bribing tenants into casting ballots against their own self interests using liquor money and other forms of monetary rewards. This story garnered attention from politicians wishing Riis would not proliferate more such attacks but it sparked even greater interest from everyday citizens seeking change from graft filled government officials who failed society’s poorest communities. A major component of Riis’ drive for journalistic success stemmed from the death of wife Elizabeth Barrett Groth in 1885; her untimely demise left four children without a mother or strong father figure leading young Riis closer toward his destiny of philanthropy rooted in moral values derived directly from scripture.","Photographer Jacob August Riis was a journalist, social reformer, and photographer.

* Air screw - Da Vinci designed a mechanism for flight called an “air screw” or ""helical airplane"". This device consists of a rotor with curved blades mounted on a shaft to produce lift via the action of helicopter rotors in motion through air . In this way, it’s believed by some modern scientists like John Brown that the invention could have flown. However there exists no evidence whether this theory ever materialized into reality beyond paper models built by Da Vinci.
* Parachute – A parachute design was sketched out showing how someone might be able survive being thrown from a tall building if they jumped without harm because their body wouldn't hit the ground due to resistance provided by a canopy attached above them. 
* Tank — Da Vinci came up with several variations including a tank with eight wheels along two axes connected together allowing cannon fire over open trenches while avoiding enemy fortifications and other obstacles . It appears likely in many ways that this design had its genesis in earlier war machines such as the Spanish “batallas moradas”, but clearly shows how military technology could develop into new forms over time. 
* Submarine – In addition to these ideas, Da Vinci drew detailed plans including various designs for submersible devices and weapons resembling a sea monster with sharp teeth. Though never built, naval architects today may still look back upon his work as visionary inspiration.","Double hull Leonardo Da Vinci was an Italian polymath, he excelled at a number of different subjects.

1. Self-Determination Policy: In 1970, President Nixon established a policy that aimed to support tribal self-determination efforts and give tribes more control over their own affairs. This included increased funding for economic development projects on reservations and greater autonomy in decision making processes involving land use and other matters affecting Indian communities.
2. Termination Policies Reversal: The Nixon Administration reversed some of the termination policies enacted by previous administrations, recognizing that they had been detrimental to many Native American communities. Instead, emphasis was shifted towards supporting community growth through education, training and technical assistance programs designed for tribes to become economically independent and self-sufficient.
3. Indian Health Service (IHS) Expansion: Nixon significantly expanded IHS funding which allowed it to provide health services beyond just curative care to preventive measures such as immunization drives against smallpox among indigenous children living on reservations.
4. Revitalization of Traditional Values: Nixon implemented policies promoting revitalization of traditional values in Native Americans through creation or expansion of cultural centers within universities along with promotion of arts among them including traditional crafts and storytelling.","1960 During the Nixon administration, there were several major issues related to Native American rights and sovereignty.

The term ""white-washing"" typically refers to a scenario in which a historically non-White character or role is played by a White actor instead of an actor who better represents their ethnicity or cultural background.

However, it seems like you might be using this term more generally to refer to any situation where White characters are represented positively compared to other races or groups.

In terms of positive portrayals of White men in media, there are many examples across various forms of entertainment such as TV shows and movies:

1. Shows depicting historical figures or events may focus on White male protagonists (e.g., The Aviator, The Right Stuff) while neglecting similar stories with women or people of color in those same eras and milieus.)
2. The latest seasons of major streaming shows have been criticized for excluding PoC and female voices from writing staffs, contributing to problematic storylines that reinforce gendered and racial biases against people not coded as heterosexual males (""Harris Burton"" on Better Call Saul S9, ""Leopold Dillon"" on This Is Us S4)
3. There's evidence of systemic discrimination in film/TV financing and distribution, e.g., studios refuse scripts from new writers if they contain lead roles for anyone other than straight White men unless they were written specifically *for* those performers despite the latter scenario being a lot harder to cast or greenlight profitably.","Boston In your question, you are asking about the representation of Black people in movies and TV shows.

This work helped establish the field of histology, or the microscopic study of body structures.

Schwann also played an important role in developing cell theory, which is the foundation of modern biology. Cell theory states that living things are composed of one or more cells, which are the basic units of life, and that all cells have certain characteristics in common.

In particular, in 1840s, Schwann published several papers describing his observations that plant and animal tissues were structurally similar but different from nonliving matter. He proposed that there must be small hollow sacs called ""schwann'sche Schlachten"" (or ""Schwann threads"") containing granules or particles. Later research showed these to correspond to various types of molecules such as sugars and fats. His discovery that food substances could be broken down by enzymes is another significant contribution he made to science.","Microscopical researches into the accordance in the structure and growth of animals and plants Theodor Schwann was a German biologist who made important contributions to the early study of cells.

She used various techniques to create her works, including:

* Symbolism: Many of Kahlo's paintings incorporate symbols and references to Mexican culture, religion, politics, and history. Her works often feature images related to fertility, femininity, death, and the suffering of others. For example, ""The Two Fridas"" (1932) features two versions of herself joined by an artery, representing the connection between Kahlo's physical pain and emotional isolation from her husband Diego Rivera. In other works like ""Tree of Hope, Tree of Life"" (c. 1946), she uses trees as metaphors for rebirth and renewal after tragedy.

* Surrealism: Some critics consider Kahlo's work to be part of the surrealist movement due to its dreamlike quality and focus on subconscious thoughts and desires. Like Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, or Leonora Carrington, Kahlo explored the inner world of women through fantastical landscapes, imagined creatures, and body transformations such as the one seen in ""What the Water Gave Me"" (1938).

* Self-Portraiture: One of Frida Kahlo's most recognizable artistic practices was to depict herself repeatedly in different settings and situations. Self-representation allowed her to explore themes of identity, personal narratives, and social commentary that extended beyond her biography into broader cultural contexts and historical events. She painted herself surrounded by indigenous textiles, costumes, traditional embroidered dresses inspired by Prehispanic cultures long before it became fashionable in mainstream culture; floral headdresses, and jewelry reminiscent of the elaborate regional folk costumes worn by Indian men. By adopting these clothing styles in her self-portraits, Kahlo disrupted gender norms and traditional expectations surrounding female fashion and beauty standards.

1. Spanish-American War experience: As Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the 1898 conflict against Spain in Cuba, Roosevelt gained firsthand knowledge of military affairs and international relations. After serving as Governor of New York from 1899 to 1901, he returned to Washington as President William McKinley's second vice president and assumed office following McKinley's assassination on September 14, 1901. This sequence of experiences exposed him to complex geopolitical issues and helped shape his views on foreign policy.

1. Economic development: By this time, America was becoming increasingly involved in global trade and industrial expansion. Business interests recognized the need for stable markets abroad and expanded infrastructure at home, encouraging political leaders like Roosevelt to contemplate the nation's growing role within the world economy.

1. Friendship with British diplomats: In addition to correspondence with friends like Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, TR maintained close relationships with prominent British statesmen such as Arthur Balfour (former Prime Minister) and Cecil Rhodes (business magnate). These contacts introduced Roosevelt to influential figures promoting greater Anglo-American understanding and collaboration.

Ultimately, a combination of domestic and international pressures shaped Roosevelt's outlook and fueled his shift toward a broader vision of American leadership and interdependence with other nations. His presidency (1901–1909) saw major advancements in foreign relations, naval modernization, conservationism, labor protections, and antitrust legislation, among many other areas reflecting his evolving beliefs and priorities.","1932 Democratic National Convention Several factors likely contributed to Theodore Roosevelt's evolution into a more prominent advocate for international cooperation and diplomacy, including:

1. In his early work, he argued that men were inherently more ""civilized"" than women and thus more able to control their instinctual desires (which is why they might be better suited for civilization).

He also wrote of the ""unassailable innocence"", saying: 'When you have fully analysed all your memories from the past and can bring yourself to write an account of them with all details included, then will appear before us, as if in a glass, darkly, this scene... You are walking upstairs; there trips over your foot a little girl.'

It was ruled by a monarch who held absolute power over the state and its territories. While the precise nature of the empire varied throughout its history, it generally consisted of three major branches: military, government, and religion.

The military branch served as the backbone of the empire and enforced laws through brute force when necessary; this included all aspects of warfare such as weaponry, tactics, strategy, logistics and communications to maintain control over both friendly and enemy populations. There were also diplomatic efforts which helped expand or contract various holdings. In terms of military organization, there were legions (large permanent units), auxiliaries/allies (less well equipped soldiers typically protecting their own lands; often locals in foreign provinces) and fleets (for naval capabilities).

Government functions were handled mostly at a local level with provincial governors administered them while periodically reporting directly to the central authority figure known as the Emperor. Augustus Caesar created a civil service system in order to help govern and run the growing empire while delegating decision making powers from Rome proper where citizens could gather as a means of checks & balances. Religion was important to ancient Romans including those serving the state. As time went on, they incorporated more gods into traditional practice out of convenience rather than actual religious beliefs.[2] Eventually Christianity arrived in the third century AD.[3] 

For trade the Romans relied heavily upon slaves and serfs to handle most laborious tasks so citizens could focus on governing or engaging in military duty, business, etc.. Soldiers received land or other stipends after retiring allowing settling new colonies which increased expansion and growth. During winter months they fortified strongholds in key strategic areas.[4].","Cilicia The Roman Empire was a vast and complex political entity that existed in Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor for nearly 1500 years.

Here's how you can do it:

1. First, install the necessary dependencies using pip or yarn depending on your preference. For example, run `pip install leaftet` if you want to use python and leaflet. 
2. Next, import the libraries into your project by adding this line at the top of your file:
```python
import jsonschema_ld
import jsonlib2 #this library can be used as a drop-in replacement for any code that uses the standard library’s json module which may not work outside of a browser environment because they are written in C. This means we will avoid issues that arise from differences between the browsers' native implementations and what happens when javascript is running natively in Nodejs or other environments with their own native json library (like electron).
```
3. Then, write some code to retrieve data from countrieslist.com API and parse it into the structure needed by the JSON schema validation library. The response is a mix of simple values like integers or strings along side of more complex structures.
This will involve parsing the result into our model objects as defined above so that the rest of our program can operate upon the contents of these.

4. Use the JSON schema validation library to validate the payload received from step three against the provided JSON schema definition before anything else gets done.  Failing here should cause immediate error without having to inspect variables since there won't be any data loaded yet except perhaps during testing phases.
5. Apply a context manager around loading any resources such as static files required for rendering components including Javascript UI templates like HTML files, CSS stylesheets etc., but also loading code in script tags inline in html or as standalone JS files (wherever these scripts might live) .

Over the course of his career, he played a significant role in multiple movements and styles, including:

1. *Blue Period (1901-1904):* In this early stage of his career, Picasso's works were characterized by their melancholic mood and color scheme dominated by shades of blue and green. He painted themes related to poverty, isolation, and human suffering during this period. His style remained true to realism for several more years even as cubist ideas started getting implemented into some pieces that retained the traditional form of figures albeit disrupted through geometric shapes e.g.*The Old Guitarist*.

2. *Rose Period (1905-1907):* During this phase, Picasso used warmer colors such as pink, orange, and red in his paintings depicting circus scenes and allegories. This change in palette signaled an easing up from the harshness of previous work. The period saw progression towards synthetic cubism or crystalloid cubism with fragmented forms starting to make their way into his compositions. Notable examples include *The Young Saltimbanque*, *The Family of Saltimbanques* amongst others.

3. *Cubism (1908–1916):* Towards late 1907, Picasso along with Georges Braques initiated another major shift when they revolutionised painting by rejecting traditional methods of perspective and modeling and replacing it with the fractured planar geometry of analytical cubism where the subject matter would be analyzed and broken down into its constituent parts of basic geometrical shapes like cylinders cones etc . Significant works that best represent this new mode are *Les Demoiselles d’Avignon*(the female prostitutes here represented quite unlike anything earlier), *Guernica* and *Painter on the Road to Saint-Domingo*. He also did works rendered almost exclusively in monochromatic whites and greys which were transitional between figuration and abstraction called Analytic Cubism . Although there might have been collaboration, these paintings leaned more to Picasso than Braques to begin with though the two were moving towards similar paths due to mutual influence. Both experimented with staccato brushwork around this time before diverging once again with development of purer cubism vs rayonisme respectively.*

4. *Surrealism (mid-1920s – mid-1930s)*: While working concurrently with cubist modes, surrealist tendencies began appearing in his work around 1920. These ideas got fully realized upon establishment of surrealism proper in mid-1920s; notable instances being Crucifixion(The Corpus Christi)_(Baldassari)_,_Vermouth_.and _Girl Before a Mirror_.","Cubism Pablo Picasso is one of the most well-known artists of the 20th century, and his work spanned many years.

1. Being born prematurely and losing her sight and hearing shortly after birth due to illness (most likely meningitis).
2. Struggling with communication as a young child since she couldn't see or hear properly. This made it difficult for her to understand words or concepts without physical contact.
3. Growing up during times of cultural, educational, and social change in America where disability stigma and isolation were commonplace. For example:
	* Disabled children often didn't attend school like their siblings or peers because education wasn't accessible or affordable - this meant there weren't trained teachers or resources available for sign language or braille teaching materials.
	* Society believed disabled individuals led shortened lives due to ""brain weakness"", so few tried innovative therapies/medicines or provided healthcare at home to extend lifespans when facing conditions related to the brain or central nervous system. Some families even separated from those living with chronic health issues outright!
4. Initially having very limited ways of communicating beyond basic hand gestures because nobody shared common signals; she eventually went on to learn several languages to improve her ability to connect with others across different spheres of influence. The lack of braille publications in English also prevented many from learning multiple foreign languages until later years of Helen’s adult life.","Deafness Helen Keller was a deaf-blind author, lecturer, and activist who overcame the many obstacles she faced to become an inspiration for people all around the world.

Escher was a Dutch graphic artist who became famous for his mathematically-based and often impossible visual illusions that challenged the viewer's perception of reality. While little is known about what specifically inspired him to pursue art, there are some notable events in his life that may have contributed:

1. Childhood interest in drawing: According to accounts from Escher's family members and school friends, he had a natural talent and fascination with sketching from a young age. His earliest recorded drawings were made when he was just four years old. It appears that this early passion for creating images fueled his love for the arts later on.
2. First encounter with printmaking: As a teenager, Escher visited a local museum with friends and saw examples of different types of prints such as woodcuts, lithographs, and etchings for the first time. He was particularly intrigued by colorful Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints on display. This experience sparked his lifelong appreciation for the technical aspects of printmaking and its potential for creative expression.
3. Encounter with Goethe’s theory of colors: When studying architecture at university, one of Escher's classmates introduced him to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's scientific treatise on color theory. Inspired by the concepts presented in the book, Escher began experimenting with color contrasts through various design exercises, including tessellations (tile patterns). These experiments would eventually lead to several iconic works featuring mind-bending optical illusions using geometric shapes.","Giovanni Battista Piranesi M.C.

Mendel's most famous experiments were conducted between 1856 and 1863 with pea plants (Pisum sativum). By cross-breeding different varieties of peas, Mendel discovered that certain characteristics consistently passed down over multiple generations without blending or distorting. These discoveries became fundamental principles of heredity: the law of dominance (which states that certain traits hide others), the law of segregation (which shows how traits are distributed to offspring) and the distinction between dominant and recessive traits.[2] Because of these basic laws of inheritance,[citation needed] Mendelian inheritance has been widely applied to agriculture, to the study of human disease (medicine), and indeed every level of biological analysis including molecular causes of life phenomena studied today at the DNA/RNA level.[2][4","Mendelian inheritance Gregor Mendel was an Austrian botanist and Augustinian friar.

* Economic turmoil in Greece: Default could lead to a sharp drop in living standards, economic collapse and social unrest. The Greek economy is already struggling and a default would only make things worse. It could also result in loss of access to international financial markets which Greece needs for growth.
* Eurozone Instability : If Greece were to default on its debts within the euro zone, it could trigger instability throughout the monetary union as investors realize that debt relief packages do not necessarily guarantee repayment. This risk premium on peripheral bonds may rise again which might cause liquidity crunch for these countries. In such scenario other weak economies like Italy , Spain etc may need additional funding too to avoid crisis . So ECB will face double whammy of increased interest rate + fiscal support needed from stronger economies. That makes this a geopolitical nightmare because European leaders can't allow EU breakup but at same time German voters won’t accept higher inflation or money printing without clear benefit so we get political gridlock
* International fallout: Greek banks own most of their government bonds so there is risk contagion among European banks who hold Greek bank stocks and derivatives linked to those stock prices","European Union A default by Greece on its debt would likely have significant consequences for both Greece and the rest of Europe.

In particular, Skinner developed the theory of radical behaviorism, which emphasizes the role of environmental factors in shaping behavior. According to this viewpoint, individual differences in behavior can largely be explained by differences in the experiences individuals have had with different consequences associated with their actions over time. In other words, Skinner argued that humans are always acting based on their past associations with various reinforcements and punishments in their environment.","Atheism B.F.

* Pine (Pinus spp.) - Another common conifer species logged in Russia, pines grow across the vast Russian taiga region spanning from Europe to Siberia and into North Asia. The resinous wood makes it suitable for many purposes such as building materials, flooring, and pulp products.
* Birch (Betula spp.) - A deciduous tree abundant across Russia's temperate and colder zones, birch has several practical uses due its close grained wood which is easily processed into veneers, flooring, furniture components, or pulped for paper manufacturing.
* Larch (Larix spp.) - This hardy cold-loving tree dominates forest areas across Russia north of 50° latitude, especially around Siberia and the Arctic coastlines. Larch produces durable, long lasting wood resistant against decay when exposed to moisture making it ideal for outdoor structures like timber framing or garden fences.
* Oak (Quercus spp.) - While not exclusive to Russia alone, oak species are found all over central European Russia and parts of southern Russia.

* Birch (Betula spp.) - A deciduous tree abundant across Russia's temperate and colder zones, birch has several practical uses due its close grained wood which is easily processed into veneers, flooring, furniture components, or pulped for paper manufacturing.
* Larch (Larix spp.) - This hardy cold-loving tree dominates forest areas across Russia north of 50° latitude, especially around Siberia and the Arctic coastlines. Larch produces durable, long lasting wood resistant against decay when exposed to moisture making it ideal for outdoor structures like timber framing or garden fences.
* Oak (Quercus spp.) - While not exclusive to Russia alone, oak species are found all over central European Russia and parts of southern Russia. Russians have employed hardwearing oakwood traditionally for furnishings within homes including tables, chairs and other decorative items, while also using this dense heavy material in shipbuilding projects past and present."

Whitman drew inspiration from many sources to develop his distinctive voice and vision as a writer. Some of these key influences on his poetry include:

* Romanticism: Whitman's poetry shares some characteristics with romantic literature in that it values individuality, emotion, intuition, and the sublime or beautiful aspects of nature. He admired writers such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
* Transcendentalism: Like other prominent figures of the transcendentalist movement such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Whitman believed in the inherent goodness of human beings and saw divinity within each person. This perspective inspired him to celebrate the diversity and dignity of all individuals through his writing.
* Democracy: Whitman passionately believed in the ideals of democracy and equality. As an outspoken advocate for social justice issues like abolitionism, he used his poetry as a tool to express progressive ideas about freedom and inclusion.
* Native American culture: Whitman admired the spiritual traditions and natural harmony of indigenous peoples living in North America at the time. Their ways of life and respect for the environment deeply affected his perception of beauty and reverence for nature.

Overall, Whitman synthesized diverse literary and cultural threads into a unique, multifaceted poetry that continues to inspire generations of readers and writers alike.","Abraham Lincoln Walt Whitman was a highly influential American poet who lived during the mid-19th century.

1. English: English is the official language of the United Kingdom and is widely spoken throughout the country. It is also the primary language used in government, education, business, and everyday life. There are many regional variations of English spoken across different parts of the UK, including Scottish English, Welsh English, Northern Irish English, and more.

English speakers living outside Wales don’t have much opportunity to learn Welsh through their daily lives – unless they live near the linguistically separate part of north west Wales where everyone routinely uses both languages; however, there is nothing stopping you learning some basics before visiting Wales!

At its height in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, it spanned three continents (Europe, Africa, and Asia), making it one of the largest Empires in history.

It consisted of several territories, including modern-day Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Sudan, and Cyprus. It also included many smaller states and dependencies.

The Ottoman Empire was governed by the Sultan, who served as both ruler and religious leader, known as Caliph. Its capital was Constantinople, now called Istanbul, located at the mouth of the Bosporus strait between Europe and Asia. During its peak, it boasted highly advanced military technologies such as cannons and muskets, allowing them greater mobility on various terrains than European knights on horseback.

With growing tensions towards the end of World War I due in part to the oppressive nature of Ottoman rule over their diverse populations, internal unrest soon turned into open rebellion against the Ottomans during the decade prior to the war's start. These rebellions came primarily from ethnic minorities within the empire seeking more autonomy or outright independence for themselves; most notably were the Christian subjects within the empire who had experienced discrimination under Ottoman rule since the empire's earliest days. Other rebels included Kurdish groups desiring recognition of their unique cultural heritage and language distinctiveness, as well as Arabic speakers looking for political representation outside of Turkish hegemony in the region once ruled by the Ottomans.","Austria-Hungary The Ottoman Empire was a historical state that existed from 1299 to 1923, with most of its territory in present-day Turkey.

3475,3475,http://www.freebase.com/view/en/danish_language,where is danish located?,Denmark,"The code you provided uses the Python programming language and some libraries. Here are a few pointers to help with the analysis:

* ""import sys"" statement imports the system module, which contains functions for inspecting your own script's state such as its modules, arguments, input/output streams, etc. This isn't needed in this context but it doesn't hurt anything either. If the system module isn't available (e.g., if running your script outside of an interpreter), another way to access those features programmatically would be through built-in modules like os or string or whatever is appropriate in each case; the function name should tell us what information it provides so there's no need to worry too much about that here).
* ""sys.set_trace()"" statement sets up tracing of execution flow inside the script via the sys._startupinfo attribute. We don't want that, though -- we want to trace our C++ application launched from Python using ctypes library calls! So let's set up a custom signal handler instead using the signal module from Python's logging subsystem:
```python
import signal
import logging
logging.getLogger(""cctext"").info(""Handling SIGUSR1."")
def on_sigusr1(signum, frame):
    print(""Caught SIGUSR1:"", signum)
    logging.getLogger(""cctext"").warning(""A user signal was sent while CCTEXT processing text..."")
    logging.shutdown()  # shut down logging before exiting program
```
This defines a function `on_sigusr1()` that prints out when a certain signal (`SIGUSR1`) has been received by any part of the Python environment handling threads created within the main process via ctypes, including ourselves launching an external binary written in a different language.

Here are a few pointers to help with the analysis:

* ""import sys"" statement imports the system module, which contains functions for inspecting your own script's state such as its modules, arguments, input/output streams, etc. This isn't needed in this context but it doesn't hurt anything either. If the system module isn't available (e.g., if running your script outside of an interpreter), another way to access those features programmatically would be through built-in modules like os or string or whatever is appropriate in each case; the function name should tell us what information it provides so there's no need to worry too much about that here).
* ""sys.set_trace()"" statement sets up tracing of execution flow inside the script via the sys._startupinfo attribute. We don't want that, though -- we want to trace our C++ application launched from Python using ctypes library calls! So let's set up a custom signal handler instead using the signal module from Python's logging subsystem:
```python
import signal
import logging
logging.getLogger(""cctext"").info(""Handling SIGUSR1."")
def on_sigusr1(signum, frame):
    print(""Caught SIGUSR1:"", signum)
    logging.getLogger(""cctext"").warning(""A user signal was sent while CCTEXT processing text..."")
    logging.shutdown()  # shut down logging before exiting program

It would be impossible to summarize everything that he contributed since it spanned across multiple years but here are some highlights: 
1) As a member of the Virginia House of Delegates from 1785-1790 he drafted resolutions expressing Virginia’s opposition to the Stamp Act and other measures of Britain which were thought to violate Colonial rights... these served as precursors/ideas used later at constitutional convention...
2) In 1786 at Annapolis MD where commissioners from various states met looking into the problems faced by all states sharing interstate commerce issues related to the “Articles of Confederation”. They found it difficult to cooperate on policy due to conflicts and competition among each state vying over narrow self interest ...and this set his desire that only representatives selected by the people themselves --not appointed or influenced by State Governments-- should attend any Convention proposing amendments . Otherwise its outcome would likely go awry like earlier efforts undertaking revisions via Legislatures acting alone...this idea became foundation principles underlying the US CONSTITUTIONAL approach ...i.e., Federalism (balance of National power vs state authority), checks & balances , rule of law etc.. Madison believed that if factions or parties arose they too should follow rules preventing abuse of power i.e., majority rule with minority protections ...all under rule of law ultimately enforced nationally instead locally controlled at every step ....He took copious notes through his public service career which laid groundwork ideas for later Constitution Committee...

He is best known for his contributions to Jewish literature and for his work as an early pioneer of printing press technology.

Schligen was born around 1480 in Bavaria, Germany, into a family of merchants and intellectuals. As a young man, he studied at several yeshivot (rabbinical academies) throughout Europe, where he developed a strong interest in both classical Jewish texts and contemporary innovations such as printing presses. By the age of 23, Schligen had established himself as one of the leading Hebrew scholars of his time.

In 1507, Schligen left his native country and traveled to Italy, where he became involved in the world of publishing. During this period, he worked closely with renowned Italian publishers such as Raphael Rebolo, who helped him set up his own print shop in Rome in 1516. From there, Schligen's reputation as a masterful printer and respected Talmudic authority quickly spread across Europe. Over the next two decades, he printed many important books on Judaism while working under various royal patronships, including that of King Ferdinand II of Aragon.

By the mid-1520s, however, political tensions were rising throughout Europe due to religious conflicts between Catholics and Protestants. In response to these hostilities, Schligen decided to leave Italy and move back to his homeland of Bavaria, where he continued to produce significant literary works until his death in 1559. Today, he remains celebrated not only for his groundbreaking developments in printing technology but also for his lasting impact on Jewish literature and culture.","Botanist Matías Schlimgen, also known as Mathias Shlich or Matthias the Levite, was a German-Jewish printer and Hebrew author who lived in the late 15th century.
