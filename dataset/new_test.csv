Post-Impressionism: This style of painting emerged in the late 19th century, after Impressionism had become established as an important movement. It emphasized color over line or form, which led artists like Matisse to develop more vibrant palettes than their predecessors. The movement's most famous works were landscapes painted at sea level by people such as Claude Monet.

Fauvism (Wild Beasts): This movement developed from about 1896 until 1907. Its name refers informally to les fauves (various wild animals) because its members used strong brushstrokes with less mixed colors so that many of its works are identical in technique; Fauve can also mean rabid in French, which reflects the destructive energy of most of those paintings as well as using a full range of pure unmodulated colour (pure colors 'out of the tube') with heavy impasto, e.g., The Garden of Paris studio, Cécile Parsonnier La Danse couchée aux palmiers 1905–1911 oil on canvas 274 × 324 cm Kunstmuseum Basel. Art historians consider this ""the first avant-garde movement""—a characterisation only assumed later by any number of similar ""isms"". They reacted against the naturalism pioneered around 1850 by Gustave Courbet, and later by Édouard Manet, both highly influential for Impressionist painters.

187,187,http://www.freebase.com/view/en/stephen_hawking,what did stephen hawking study?,Physics,"Stephen Hawking was a renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist who made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of the universe. He studied black holes, quantum mechanics, general relativity, and the origins of the cosmos.

His work spanned many areas of physics and math, including differential geometry, topology, and thermodynamics. Some key topics he explored include:

1. Black holes: Hawking showed that black holes emit radiation due to quantum effects near their event horizons, now known as Hawking radiation. This led him to propose that information could be recovered from black hole interiors after all, resolving a paradox in quantum theory.
2. Quantum mechanics: His work on quantum mechanics included developing new approaches for calculating the behavior of quantum systems using path integrals or Hartree–Fock methods. He also collaborated with other researchers on quantum computing.
3. General relativity: In general relativity, Hawking proposed important concepts like gravitational entropy and the holographic principle. The latter suggests that gravity is emergent from some underlying fundamental structure, possibly connected to quantum information theory.
4. Cosmology: For cosmology, Hawking's major contributions involved studying how the early universe behaved shortly after the Big Bang. Among his ideas were proposing inflationary models to explain the observed large-scale structures of the cosmos. He also researched ""quantum cosmology"" and how initial conditions affected later evolution.
5. Mathematical physics: Finally, much of Hawking's work required expertise in mathematical physics areas like topology change in spacetime, singularities prevention by finiteness constraints, and numerical solutions involving partial differential equations (PDE).","Physics Stephen Hawking was a renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist who made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of the universe.

Major trading partners are Asia's industrial hubs like China, Taiwan, South Korea, and India. Coal exports to major importers include Japan, China, South Korea, and India. Oil production meets domestic demand while excess crude oil goes into international trade.

* Heaven is seen as a spiritual realm where believers go after death to be with God in eternal happiness and peace. It is often described as a perfect place of love, joy, and fulfillment, free from pain, suffering, and sin. The Bible mentions heaven numerous times, including in passages such as John 14:2-3 and Revelation 21-22.
* Hell, also known as Gehenna or Hades, is understood as a place of punishment for those who reject God and his offer of salvation through Jesus Christ. This is not just an absence of good but active torment inflicted by demons and Satan himself. The Bible describes this fate as ""eternal fire,"" ""everlasting destruction"" (Matthew 10:28), ""shame and contempt,"" and burning sulfur (Revelation 14:9-11). Many Christians emphasize that it is not God who sends people to hell but their own rejection of him.
* Purgatory is traditionally defined as a temporary state between life and full union with God in heaven. Catholics particularly teach this doctrine based on certain biblical hints and early Church traditions. The purpose of purgatory would be to purify souls from any remaining sins or imperfections before entering God's presence. Some Protestants hold similar views under different names like ""the intermediate state.""","Greek Evangelical Church As a non-religious AI language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions.

These organizations were formed as a way for working people to collectively bargain for better wages and working conditions with their employers, and they became increasingly important in the years leading up to the Russian Revolution in 1917.

The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, saw these trade unions as an essential part of building socialism and ensuring worker control over industry. In 1920, the first Congress of Soviets was held in Moscow, at which delegates elected representatives to serve on the Supreme Council of Trade Unions, which would later become known simply as the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions (VSK). This new organization brought together all of the regional trade union councils into one national body, representing millions of workers across the Soviet Union.

Over time, the role and influence of the VSK expanded beyond just labor issues and into broader political and economic areas. By the mid-20th century, it had grown to include numerous subdivisions responsible for different aspects of economic planning and management, such as industrial output targets, materials allocation, quality assurance, pricing policy, standardization and norm setting, occupational safety standards, etc. It functioned as a de facto centralized agency coordinating various sectors of the national economy under its jurisdiction.","Uzbekistan The word ""Soviet"" comes from the Russian word for council or assembly (совет) and refers to the unions of workers and peasants that sprang up across the country during the early 20th century.

She is most famous for writing the ""Little House"" series of children's novels, which were first published between 1932 and 1943. The nine volumes in this series chronicle Laura's life as a young pioneer girl, from her birth in 1867 to her marriage in 1885.

Laura based these stories largely on her own memories and experiences, but she also drew upon family letters, diaries, and other sources to create an authentic depiction of life on the western frontier during that time period. Her father was a carpenter, farmer, and preacher who moved his wife and four daughters around by covered wagon trying to make a better life for them. It wasn't easy at all! But it seems they made good and finally settled when he got a job with the rail road as an inspector - thus making him able to pay for land and build their first real home ever where even two of Rose Wilder's homes now stand (Rose was one of their daughter whom never left Rocky Ridge Farm).

* He played a significant role in shaping Reconstruction policies aimed at reuniting the country and rebuilding devastated Southern states. However, many of these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful or reversed due to political conflict and racial inequality concerns.
* The most notable piece of legislation that he signed into law while President was the Tenure of Office Act (TOMA), which restricted the power of the President to dismiss officials without senatorial consent, thus reducing executive authority granted by Congress under the previous two Presidents. This act directly impacted Johnson's own Cabinet, who resigned in protest when they felt their powers had been usurped by Congress; this included the Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who would later play a vital role in the impeachment trial that followed","Reconstruction after the Civil War As the seventh President of the United States, Andrew Johnson was a complex figure with a controversial legacy.

In autumn 1927 Schwann enrolled into a gymnasium secondary school called the Gymnasium Trjakum in Cologne; attending courses between spring 1830 and Easter 1831 but without obtaining Abitur, which would have enabled university entrance qualification. From April 1831 until Christmas Day 1833 he lived in Berlin as an assistant primary-school teacher and attended lectures on physics by Johann Gottlieb Bisch and chemistry by Christian Friedrich Wimmer and others at the University of Berlin which had no effect upon him.[1][not specific enough to verify] Subsequently between Autumn 1833 and Summer 1834 he attended a Catholic theological seminary named Saxonian Landesschule Pforta [Landessternschule] Schulpforte[1][3] located about one kilometer eastwards outside Dresden within Kingdom of Saxony. He remained there up to Michaelmas (29 September) in the following year 1834 attending classes preparing pupils for entering any German university including those in far away Prussia.[1] During Spring 1835 he transferred into University of Leipzig, intending this time to take full advantage with passionate dedication so typical of young people since then.[citation needed] Despite financial struggles because of his abandonment of Protestantism, he completed his coursework towards bachelor's degree without incurring debts and obligations."

Overall her background contains several elements such as writing poetry professionally; being active within the Civil Rights movement, working within the sex trade industry, surviving a teen pregnancy; growing up with segregation/racial prejudices that limited her opportunities within the US thus requiring relocation elsewhere… All these aspects make up the complex personhood behind how Maya Angelou became who we know today—an iconic role model known across races as an influencer with exceptional artistry"

While he had a modest upbringing and came from a middle-class family, he was able to build substantial wealth through various means during his presidency.

One major source of Mubarak's wealth was through corruption. He used his position of power to enrich himself by receiving bribes and kickbacks from government contracts and business deals. Additionally, there were allegations that he siphoned off state funds for personal use and owned luxury properties both within Egypt and abroad.

Mubarak also had close ties with influential businesspeople who would often secure favorable treatment of their interests in exchange for financial benefits for the former president and his inner circle. Some of these individuals even reportedly served as intermediaries between Mubarak and international arms dealers and other shady characters.

Overall, it appears that Mubarak's rise to immense wealth was fueled largely by his willingness to exploit his political influence for personal gain at the expense of the ordinary people of Egypt.","Politician Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is believed to have accumulated significant wealth during his time in power.

1. Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism for genetic research: Morgan recognized that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, could be an ideal organism for studying genetics because they have short generation times and large numbers of progeny per adult female. He used them extensively in his laboratory to study genes associated with specific traits such as eye color or wing shape. His work helped establish Drosophila as a major model organism for genetics research, still widely used today.
2. Identification of sex-linked inheritance: One of the earliest discoveries made by Morgan and his students was identifying the chromosome responsible for sex determination in fruit flies (the X chromosome). They also discovered a previously unknown mechanism involving crossing over between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, leading to variations within species and allowing for genetic mapping of traits on those chromosomes. This laid the foundation for understanding sex-linked inheritance.
3. Genetic recombination: The process of ""recombining"" traits from parents into offspring through sexual reproduction via crossing over events in meiosis was first observed by Morgan's student Alfred Sturtevant while working with Drosophila stocks generated from crosses initiated at Columbia University. Recombination allows for increased variability and promotes evolutionary adaptation by producing new gene combinations not possible through simple Mendelian segregation alone. Recombinants will often be more fit than either of their parent variants due to heterozygote advantage.","Chromosome Thomas Hunt Morgan is credited with making several important contributions to the field of genetics.

He rose from poverty to become one of the richest men in the world, as well as one of the most influential philanthropists of his era.

Carnegie built his fortune through a combination of shrewd investments and astute business strategies. In particular, he focused on consolidating smaller iron and steel companies into larger, more efficient enterprises that could compete with foreign manufacturers. By the mid-1870s, he had established himself as a leading figure in the steel industry by forming several large corporations that were able to lower costs and increase production efficiency.

One of his greatest achievements was founding Carnegie Steel Company in 1892, which later became known as U.S. Steel after merging with other major steelmakers. Throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Carnegie Steel grew rapidly due to its innovative management practices and technological advancements such as the Bessemer process for making steel. The company also invested heavily in research and development to improve steel quality, allowing it to maintain market share even during periods of economic downturn or increased competition from abroad.","U.S. Steel Andrew Carnegie was a Scottish-American industrialist who played a critical role in the expansion of the American steel industry in the late 19th century.

1. Nature: Gaudí often drew inspiration from natural forms and structures in his designs, using curved lines and organic shapes to create a sense of harmony with the surrounding environment. He believed that architecture should be derived from nature and that it should work with its surroundings rather than imposing upon them.
2. Gothic Architecture: Gaudí was heavily influenced by medieval Gothic architecture, which he admired for its structural innovations and intricate detail work. His use of curved arches, ribbed vaults, and other ornamental features reflect this influence.
3. Islamic Art: Gaudí studied Islamic art and architecture during his travels through Andalusia as part of his education. The geometric patterns and arabesque motifs present in many of his buildings can be traced back to these studies.
4. Catalan Modernisme: Gaudí was also deeply involved in the Catalan modernista movement, which sought to establish Barcelona as a center of cultural and artistic excellence. This movement emphasized nationalism, and Gaudí incorporated elements of Catalan culture into his designs, such as the use of the flag's colors (red and yellow) in some of his tiling work.","William Morris Antoni Gaudí's works were influenced by various sources including nature, religion, and other architectural styles.

The exact percentage can vary from year to year depending on various factors such as the court's workload and the availability of justices, but generally speaking, only a tiny fraction of all petitions receive full consideration by the court.

In recent years, the court has received thousands of petitions annually, with the number ranging anywhere from around 7,000 to more than 15,000 per year over the past few decades. However, in most instances, the court denies certiorari (the legal term for granting a case) in all but a handful of those petitions each year.

For example, during the October 2019-September 2020 term, approximately 8% of petitions were granted plenary review by the U.S. Supreme Court — that is, accepted fully for argument and decision — whereas another 16% were ""called"" or distributed among the court’s sitting justices to be handled summarily, i.e., decided without formal briefs or oral argument because they raise issues that do not merit further review. According to statistics maintained by SCOTUSblog: During its 2013 Term, the Court disposed of 74 additional petitions through Summary Action, beyond those taken up for Plenary Review.[[1](https://www.scotusblog.com/statistics/)]

Overall, then, while there's no specific target percentage, the court takes extremely few cases for final disposition under Article III; this allows both to ensure that truly important questions will reach the Justices eventually, while also leaving lower courts free to resolve lesser disputes efficiently and thoughtfully.[[2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/overview.html)]","United States of America The United States Supreme Court typically takes a small percentage of all cases that are petitioned to it for review.

* Music and dancing - The sounds of music and laughter often fill the air at nightclubs, bars, and public squares as locals come together to sing, dance, or jam on instruments like guitars and treses (a traditional guitar).
* Beach days and water play - With beautiful beaches stretching along much of Cuba's coastline, it's no surprise that beachgoing, surfing, and boating are popular activities. Visitors can also cool off from the heat with refreshing dips in the sea, splash around natural springs called ""cuevas,"" or just relax on warm sand.
* Art - From street art installations to more formal gallery exhibits, visual arts flourish across Cuba. A handful of state-run and privately owned galleries display paintings, sculptures, textiles, jewelry, and other pieces crafted by talented island artists. Many works depict everyday life scenes and vibrant color palettes that reflect the Caribbean climate's sunny dispositions.
* Food and drink - People always seem to be gathered over plates piled high with savory treats such as black beans and rice, roasted meats, plantains, and fritters stuffed with chicken or ground beef. Locals may then wash down these hearty dishes with icy tropical juices like papaya, mango, and hibiscus-infused teas made sweet with sugarcane juice; some restaurants offer local mojitos made with fresh herbs and spices to help visitors fully experience all five senses while dining al fresco.","¡Cuba!

Raphael's paintings include portraits, altarpieces, landscapes, and narrative religious scenes that were admired by both fellow artists and patrons of his time. Some of his most famous works are:

1. The School of Athens (1509-1511): This large fresco depicts a gathering of ancient Greek philosophers engaged in discussion, including Plato and Aristotle. It captures the intellectual vitality of classical learning and its continuation through Christian theology.
2. The Divine Madonna or Madonna del Sedao (ca. 1508): A portrait of Mary holding her son Jesus Christ, which displays a tender affection between mother and child with detailed rendering of textiles and jewels.
3. Transfiguration (1472): An oil on panel painting that shows the moment when Christ glowed before St. Peter, James and John, as Moses and Elijah appeared next to him.

Some highlights include ancient Egyptian mummies, Mesopotamian treasures from Iraq, Parthenon sculptures from Ancient Greece, Anglo-Saxon treasure hoards and precious artefacts from across Asia including China and India.

2. Take a walk through historic Greenwich where you can see the Royal Observatory which houses an impressive collection of astronomical instruments as well as being home to the Prime Meridian - zero degrees longitude known locally as 'the centre of time'. The views up here are also stunning looking out across the River Thames to Canary Wharf and beyond eastwards right along the longest river in England!

3. Take a ride on the Tube (London Underground) or one of its sister modes of transport such as overground trains around Greater London or on buses either within zones or between neighbouring counties like Essex & Kent which also have lots more green spaces but still contain plenty of historical landmarks dotted throughout each county's expansive countryside areas.  If you buy an Oyster Card/contactless payment card it should work wherever you go whether underground, overland or cross country.","Regent's Park London is a great place for exploring history, art, culture and modern-day entertainment.

He is considered one of the most important figures in American popular music history, known for his innovative playing style, distinct voice, and influential contributions to swing and later forms of jazz.

Armstrong's sound on the trumpet became famous for its expressive lyrical quality and virtuosic technique. In addition, he developed new techniques such as ""two-note"" style of playing, using intervals of a diatonic scale rather than melodies of single notes. This approach became widely adopted by subsequent generations of players, including Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie.

During his career, Armstrong recorded numerous tunes that showcased different aspects of his musicality. Some of these songs include:

* What A Wonderful World - A ballad originally released in 1967, this song has become an iconic expression of hope and optimism. The track features Armstrong singing in his distinctive velvety tone while accompanied by strings and a simple piano line. It gained more widespread recognition when used in the film Good Morning Vietnam (1987).
* Weather Report - Written by pianist Wayne Shorter, this composition provided the title cut for their album Weather Report (1970), which featured several other top musicians such as bassists Miroslav Vitous and Chick Corea. Recorded during the latter half of Satchmo’s life span, it spotlights him backed only by the rhythm section of bassist Al Hall and drummer Barrett Deems. Atmospherically, this performance recalls Armstrong’s first session with All Stars ten years earlier because all three participants solo over an obbligato stop-time tempo rather than accompanying atop chordal or scalar harmony. The fact that they do so without any difficulty attests to how far each had evolved since the initial recordings together near six decades beforehand; however, even more significantly, it also indicates something less obvious but potentially more meaningful about this collaboration: They truly love making great art collaboratively.”
* Melancholy – One of many memorable moments from Satch Plays Fats (2000) — arguably my favorite collection on account of its focus being Pops’ take on various selections from the Greatest Jazz Composer Ever","Jazz Louis Armstrong was a talented jazz musician who played the trumpet and sang.

While it shares many commonalities with traditional Jewish customs and beliefs from other regions around the world, there are some unique characteristics that distinguish modern Judah:

1. Influence of Zionist ideology: The founders of Modern Judah were heavily influenced by Zionist philosophy, which emphasizes the need for a Jewish homeland in Palestine where Jews can exercise their national identity freely. This has led to several key differences between Modern Judah and other forms of Judaism, including a greater focus on self-determination, independence, and sovereignty over its own land.
2. Incorporation of Western culture: As a product of the 20th century, Modern Judah reflects the influence of Western culture and technology in its religious practice, such as the use of electric lights during Hanukkah celebrations instead of traditional olive oil lamps. Additionally, Hebrew has been revived as a spoken language through the work of Eliezer Ben-Yehuda and his dictionary entries.[7 m]
3. Secularization of society: Despite being rooted in religion, modern Judah is characterized by a high degree of secularization, especially among younger generations who view themselves more as Israelis than strictly as Jews.[8 m]
4. Relationship with non-Jewish communities:Modern Judah's approach towards non-Jewish communities is largely shaped by political considerations related to the conflict with surrounding Arab countries, resulting in increased security concerns for the majority Ashkenazi community and discrimination against the minority Mizrahi and Sephardi populations.[6 m].

Due to these factors, modern Judah includes elements of both tradition and innovation and continues to evolve in response to changing societal and political conditions.","Jerusalem Modern Judah, also known as the State of Israel or Israeli Judaism, refers to the Jewish religious and cultural practices in Israel since the establishment of the state in 1948.
